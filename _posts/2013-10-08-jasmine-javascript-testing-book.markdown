Hey guys its been a long time without posts! So I'm here to recommend a book, that my coworker and friend [Paulo Ragonha](http://paulo.ragonha.me) recently wrote.

[Jasmine Javascript Testing](http://bit.ly/195WG9g) is a book about how to be a pro in javascript testing.

I highly recommend the reading, since you will learn a lot of good practices when developing modern Javascript aplications.

Hope you enjoy!
